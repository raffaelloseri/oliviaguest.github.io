I am a professor of Econometrics at the 
<a href="http://eco.uninsubria.it">Department of Economics</a>
of the 
<a href="https://www.uninsubria.it">Università degli Studi dell'Insubria</a>. 
I am also a member of the Center for Nonlinear and Complex Systems, in the same University. I have a Laurea and a PhD in Industrial Engineering from Politecnico di Milano, a DEA in Mathematics applied to Social Sciences from Université Paris Dauphine/ENSAE and a PhD in Mathematics from Université Paris Dauphine. I have published in:

Hi, I am a cognitive computational neuroscientist currently carrying
out <a href="http://bradlove.org/lab#postdocs">postdoctoral research</a>
with <a href="//bradlove.org/">Prof. Bradley C. Love</a> in the <a href="//www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/research/experimental-psychology/person/olivia-guest/">Department
of Experimental Psychology</a>, <a href="//www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/people/profiles/research-staff/olivia-guest">Division
of Psychology and Language Sciences</a>, <a href="//iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=OGUES12">University
College London</a>.
</p>
<p> My undergraduate degree was in <a href="https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/undergraduate/ug-courses/bsc-cs/">Computer
Science</a>. After that, I moved on to an <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/study/masters/TMSPSYSCDS01">MSc in
Cognitive and Decision Sciences</a>. I then undertook a <a href="http://www.bbk.ac.uk/psychology/">PhD in Psychology</a> on
computational models for semantic memory.
</p>
<p> My current research primarily involves the creation and evaluation
of computational accounts â¬ such as deep and shallow artificial
neural networks â¬ for categorisation and conceptual representation in
healthy adults, patient groups, infants, and animal models. I also have
interests in computational modelling and data science more broadly,
e.g., <a href="http://redistrict.science">redistrict.science</a>.
