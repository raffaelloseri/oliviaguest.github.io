I am a professor of Econometrics at the
<a href="http://eco.uninsubria.it">Department of Economics</a>
of the
<a href="https://www.uninsubria.it">Universit&agrave; degli Studi dell'Insubria</a>.
I am also a member of the Center for Nonlinear and Complex Systems, in the same University. I have a Laurea and a PhD in Industrial Engineering from Politecnico di Milano, a DEA in Mathematics applied to Social Sciences from Universit&eacute; Paris Dauphine/ENSAE and a PhD in Mathematics from Universit&eacute; Paris Dauphine. I have published in:

<p> My undergraduate degree was in <a href="https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/undergraduate/ug-courses/bsc-cs/">Computer
Science</a>. After that, I moved on to an <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/study/masters/TMSPSYSCDS01">MSc in
Cognitive and Decision Sciences</a>. I then undertook a <a href="http://www.bbk.ac.uk/psychology/">PhD in Psychology</a> on
computational models for semantic memory.
</p>
<p> My current research primarily involves the creation and evaluation
of computational accounts such as deep and shallow artificial
neural networks for categorisation and conceptual representation in
healthy adults, patient groups, infants, and animal models. I also have
interests in computational modelling and data science more broadly,
e.g., <a href="http://redistrict.science">redistrict.science</a>.
